# '''
# You are given an unweighted, undirected graph. Write a program to check if it's a tree topology.
#
# Input Format
# The first line of the input file contains two integers N and M --- number of nodes and number of edges in the graph.
# Next M lines contain M edges of that graph --- Each line contains a pair (u, v) means there is an edge between node u and node v.
#
# Constraints
# (0 <= u, v < N)
# (0 < N <= 10000, 0 <= M <= 20000)
#
# Output Format
# Print YES if the given graph is a tree, otherwise print NO.
#

# Sample Output 0
